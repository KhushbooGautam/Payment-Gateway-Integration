        This sector is decentralized and highly labor intensive. It is spread all over the country in rural and urban areas and substantially supports weaker sections of the society including women, SC/STs and minorities. However, these communities are also often affected by issues of substance abuse, petty crime, gender inequality, malnutrition and lack of sanitation. We find many of these problems can be solved by empowering mothers to to be economically independent and educating children and youth. We need some more time in this field to establish collaborations with appropriate groups.</p>
